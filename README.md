This JavaScript code prints all dates between two given years that remains the same, if numbers of the date are reversed.

## How the Code Works

The code is implemented as a JavaScript function called `printBonusDatesBetween`, which takes two parameters: `startYear` and `endYear`. It iterates through the years, months, and days, checking if the date formed by concatenating the year, month, and day remains the same when its digits are reversed.

## Usage

To use this code, simply call the `printBonusDatesBetween` function with your desired `startYear` and `endYear` as arguments. For example:

```javascript
printBonusDatesBetween(2010, 2015);
```
